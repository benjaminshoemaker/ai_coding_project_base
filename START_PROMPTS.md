** Fresh start
Read the following files (AGENTS.md, TECHNICAL_SPEC.md, EXECUTION_PLAN.md, PRODUCT_SPEC.md) to understand the structure & purpose of this repository, and familiarize yourself with the code.

** Phase prep
I want to execute all the tasks in Phase 2 from EXECUTION_PLAN.md. Before doing that, can you check if there are any unmet prerequisites that I need to create or supply? Furthermore, looking at the instructions & thinking about the code to implement, are there any permissions that we need to add to your configuration files so that you can autonomusly execute on all the steps and tasks in Phase 2?

** Phase start
I want to execute all the steps and tasks in Phase 3 from EXECUTION_PLAN.md, one at a time. Do not check back until Phase 3 is complete, unless there is a blocking problem. Read the .md files (including AGENTS.MD and EXECUTION_PLAN.md) in the base directory thoroughly for any other conventions to follow. I want you to use the code-verification skill for every task execution.
